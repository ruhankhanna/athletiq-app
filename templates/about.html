                    <strong>athletIQ is the high-tech recruiting platform for college track &amp; field and XC coaches.</strong><br><br>
                    Every coach gets a secure account to upload and save their school’s standards—supporting multiple event standards and custom performance bands. Coaches can upload athlete profiles (from athletic.net) to unlock deep analytics: machine learning-powered fit scores, trajectory predictions, clutch factor (big race performance detection), consistency metrics, event diversity, and interactive trend visualizations for running, jumping, and throwing events.<br><br>
                    <strong>Mass Search:</strong> Instantly search for recruits by uploading your saved standards, selecting states, and setting performance bands. Filter by event diversity, consistency, and more—then download full contact info for every matching athlete as a CSV.<br><br>
                    <strong>athletIQ is already deployed at multiple NCAA D1 and D3 programs</strong>, helping coaches recruit smarter, faster, and more fairly. Our mission: make recruiting faster, fairer, and more data-driven—so every program can scout talent with the clarity and confidence of a pro analytics department.
